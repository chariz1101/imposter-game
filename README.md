# 🕵️ Imposter Game

A modern, neon-themed "pass and play" social deduction game built with React and Vite. Players must determine who among them is the "Imposter" while the Imposter tries to blend in without knowing the secret word.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Setup:** Choose a category (e.g., Animals, Places) and the number of players.
2. **Pass the Device:** The game will guide you to pass the device to each player securely.
3. **Learn Your Role:**
   - **Civilians:** You will see a secret word (e.g., "Pizza").
   - **The Imposter:** You will see "YOU ARE THE IMPOSTER" and *won't* know the secret word.
4. **Discuss & Vote:** Once everyone has seen their role, the timer starts. Ask questions to figure out who doesn't know the word!
